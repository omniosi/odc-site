				<p>No matter the era, you pretty much know what you're going to get when Superman arrives on the scene. Batman, conversely, is a little more of a mixed bag: is he going to represent the campy Caped Crusader or the deadly serious Dark Knight?</p>
				<p>It's a question that has been pondered for decades, and ultimately decided by whoever's pulling his creative strings, but never has it been done more clearly than in the various animated productions. Beginning with <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em> in the Nineties and continueing through different series and animated films, incuding the upcoming <em>Batman: Attack on Arkham</em>, Bruce Wayne has run the gamut from the guy you'd like to have a beer with to the one you'd never want to meet in a dark alley.</p>

					Given the success of Tim Burton’s <i>Batman</i> in 1989, it’s hardly surprising that Warner Bros. would want to do a new animated take on the character, particlularly with sequel <i>Batman Returns</i> reaching cinemas in 1992.
				</p>
				<p>The studio turned to the team of Bruce Timm and Eric Radomski to serve as producers, with their first move being to create a two-minute promotional trailer that represented their take.</p>
				<p>“One of the things we stipulated up front,” explains Timm, “was that we would like to do the series, but ponly if we can do it our way. If you want a slavish imitation of the movie, forget it. I didn’t want it to be Tim Burton’s second cousin.” </p>
				<p>The trailer that sold the show served as the conceptual template for what would emerge as its look – a noir-ish approach with a dark and brooding intensity that would use heavily stylized animation to give the show a look different to any animated series that had appeared on television before. Eschewing the bizarre Burton-esque landscape of the feature films, Timm and Radomski utilised a unique art-deco look based on work by Twenties filmmakers in the tradition of Fritz Lang.</p>
				<p>As for the Dark Knight himself, Timm says, “Batman is such a stylised character. He’s almost like an icon. He’s different from any other superhero. He’s a good guy but he looks like the bad guy. There are so many elements of his character and different genres that can apply to him. Early on, when Eric and I and Paul Dini, who was our first semi-story editor, and an outside writer, Mitch Brian, were called in to develop the series from scratch, we asked ourselves, ‘What would we like to do with this series?’ We made a list of all these different influences that we’d like to see on the show: pulp magazine stuff, <i>The Shadow</i>, old gangster movies from the Forties, film noir from the Fifties and German Expressionism from the Twenties, and certain comic-books that really influenced us a lot."</p>
				<p>“What was really great about our show is that many characters, particularly Batman, underwent a lot of character growth through the run of the series,” adds Dini. “It adds a richness and texture to the show. We knew what we wanted when we got there, and it was this very nice eveolution of the show through script.”</p>
				<p>Laughs producer Alan Burnett, “What we did was not magic. It was going back to the comic-books and trying to do serious stories with Batman, which people hadn't done before on television. That was our goal: to put a comic book on television: a <i>real</i> comic-book, a fanboy comic-book. And it worked. I dare say that this was one of the first modern childeren’s programmes that had machine guns. We had fist-fights, judo fights, big giant threats, guns and gangsters, so it wa different. The blessing was that we were not on Saturday mornings; we were an afternoon show, and so were allowed to get [ away with ] a lot more than we would have on Saturday morning. Consequently, we got audiences across the board in terms of age. It was definitely a big difference. In my day when I worked on <i>Super Friends</i>, you weren’t even allowed to make a fist and shake it.”</p>
				<p>The show’s success led to the release of the theatrical animated film <i>Batman: Maks of the Phantasm</i> in 1993, as well as the made-for-video film <i>Batman &amp; Mr Freeze:SubZero</i> in 1998. Then came spin-off/continuation <i>The New Batman Adventures</i> from 1997 - 99, which focused largely on supporting characters like Robin and Batgirl. Those episodes, as well as <i>B:TAS</i>, became part of a package with animated Superman shows known as The New Batman/Superman Adventures from 1997 - 2000.</p>

				<p>One of the more intriguing animated takes on the Dark Knight has to be <i>Batman Beyond</i>, which jumps 50 years into the future and sees an elderly Wayne mentoring teenager Terry McGiniss as his successor. As such, it offers up a take on Batman that puts him in a whole new world and rogue's gallery. Indeed, its influence is being felt to this day, with new comics and an animated short that aired as part of DC Nation.</p>
				<p>Producer Paul Dini explains, “They were looking for a new take on Batman. We thought about it. If we did young Bruce Wayne before he puts on the Bat-suit, there’s no Batman. It might be interesting from a fan point of view and a storytelling view to tell those stories, but you don't have the colorful villians or high technology. What if we did something that was sort of a continuing of our Batman established continuity, but we set it in the future, where Bruce Wayne might be teaching the tricks of the trade to someone who’s a young apprentice? Not necessarily Robin, but someone that wants to be — or needs to be — Batman. Once we started doing that, the people involved were thinking, ‘This is really interesting, because we’re not denying our <i>Batman</i> tradition; we’re building another chapter onto it. We can aways go back and fill in the gaps.</p>
				<p>“At the same time,” he goes on, “we didn't want to be tied to the old <i>Batman</i> show. So we came up with the idea of Terry McGinnis and the concept that Bruce Wayne’s company has fallen into other hands and he has faded into the background. So the company is now run by evil people, and this creates a bond between him and Terry in trying to fight these people on different levels. That really seemed like an interesting concept, as long as we kept the relationship between them really edgy, there was a generational difference between them, and it wasn’t like Batman and Robin with, ‘Come on chum, let’s go fight the Riddler again.’ We really thought we had a unique series.”</p>
				<p>Emphasises Burnett, “What they wanted was a version of Batman that would appeal to younger audiences, so they figured if they made Batman younger, they’d get younger audiences. But they were making a younger Batman with the same team that made an older Batman, and our sensibilities were still pretty PG. They weren’t G-rated. So <i>Batman Beyond</i>, in some ways, is an even harsher show than <i>Batman: The Animated Series</i>.”</p>
				<p>In 2000, Warner Home Video released the film <i>Return of the Joker</i>, which had Terry going up against a resurrected version of the clown prince of crime. Three years later they brought out <i>Mystery of the Batwoman</i>, which set things back in the present.</p>
